# Barker-UI

This repo contains an experiment to demo Micro-Frontends. Barker is Twitter for Dogs. This Micro-Frontend UI is built with `React` and `Vue.js`, both frameworks appear in the UI using `single-spa` to hand the mount/unmounting depending on the route.

The navbar and login process are written with vue.js.

The profile and feed pages are written with react.js.

**This is not a production application, it was written for experimentation and demo purposes.**

## To Run:

This project runs in conjunction with my Barker-API project. 

Instructions are coming soon...
